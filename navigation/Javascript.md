## Javascript

## Introduction
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm programming language. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

## History
JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. It was originally developed under the name Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript.

## Features
- **Dynamic Typing**: JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.
- **Prototype-Based**: JavaScript uses prototypes instead of classes for inheritance.
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects.
- **Event-Driven**: JavaScript is often used for event-driven programming, especially in web development.
