## Ruby

## Introduction
Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection.

## History
Ruby was conceived on February 24, 1993, by Yukihiro Matsumoto. It was designed to be a more powerful scripting language than Perl and more object-oriented than Python.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented**: Everything in Ruby is an object.
- **Dynamic Typing**: Ruby is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.
- **Garbage Collection**: Ruby uses garbage collection to manage memory.
- **Expressive Syntax**: Ruby has a clean and expressive syntax that is easy to read and write.
