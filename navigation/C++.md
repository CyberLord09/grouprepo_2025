## C++

## Introduction
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". It has imperative, object-oriented, and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

## History
C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs starting in 1979. The language was designed to be an extension of C, with additional features for object-oriented programming.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented**: C++ supports object-oriented programming, including classes and inheritance.
- **Low-Level Manipulation**: C++ allows for low-level memory manipulation.
- **Performance**: C++ is known for its performance and efficiency.
- **Standard Library**: C++ has a rich standard library, including the Standard Template Library (STL).
