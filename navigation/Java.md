## Java

## Introduction
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

## History
Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented**: Everything in Java is an object which makes it easy to extend.
- **Platform-Independent**: Java code is compiled into bytecode which can be run on any platform using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Simple and Secure**: Java is designed to be easy to use and secure, with built-in security features.
- **Multithreaded**: Java supports multithreading, which allows the execution of multiple threads simultaneously.
- **Robust**: Java has strong memory management, exception handling, and type checking mechanisms.

## Basic Syntax
Here is a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
