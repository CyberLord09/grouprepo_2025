## Python
## Introduction
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

## History
Python was conceived in the late 1980s and its implementation began in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, and Python 3.0 was released in 2008.

## Features
- **Easy to Learn and Use**: Python has a simple syntax that is easy to learn and use.
- **Interpreted Language**: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter.
- **Cross-Platform**: Python can run on various platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).
- **Extensive Libraries**: Python has a large standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages.
